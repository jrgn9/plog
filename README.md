# plog
    
plog is a command line tool for creating project logs and entries from CLI. Keep track of projects (or anything) by having simple log files. Perfect for large school projects that require progress documentation. Written in Bash.

> This program was mostly created so that I could write logs when doing my bachelor's thesis as well as having something to showcase when applying for jobs. The program has done that well, but I do not have any use for it anymore and will not develop it any further. The code can still be found at Codeberg.
